## Tekdi’s Product First, Sustainable Open source approach to innovation & creation

Our distinctive approach to creation is the direct result of our core values & is a key aspect of the Spirit of Tekdi. 

If you were to visualise Software products or projects as a pyramid, you will realise that they are built out of several foundational building blocks at their base levels. The key differentiator & innovation lies at the apex of this pyramid. 

One of our values is **Enjoy the magic of creation**. And yes the euphoria you can get  of creation is amazing .. and even more so.. when you are innovating & creating something new. Leveraging open source & reusing code in your projects lets you unlock more capacity to innovate. 

Your Project will often need you to improve these foundational building blocks. When these changes are done as contributions, you are unlocking value for the larger community by bringing more capabilities & for your project/client by reducing the burden to maintain generic capabilities. This is what we call as **Sustainable Open Source**

Contributing to open source  needs a **Product First** mind set.. it needs you to **Build for most, Not for few**. It allows you to **Give Back** as a practice, intentionally with every project you deliver & every product you build. 

The Product First, Opensource core way of building that Tekdi brings to the table is not the easiest way to deliver. It needs you to Give your Best. 

**This way is what differentiates us .. Sets us apart.**
